== Introduction to Ansible Rulebooks

In this exercise, you will learn how to write an Ansible Rulebook, which is a
set of instructions that connects events to actions. You will be provided
with an Ansible playbook that handles PVC (Persistent Volume Claim) and
VolumeSnapshot creation.

Your task is to create a rulebook that triggers an Ansible Job within automation
controller that creates a PVC Snapshot.

== Prerequisites

* Access to your Bastion Host Credentials
* Access to your controller admin token
* Access to the automation controller dashboard
* SSH capabilities to the Bastion Host via terminal
* Access to the Git repository, demos, with the exercises
* Installation of the Ansible Rulebook container image via `podman`

=== Access the Bastion Host

Using the bastion host credentials, `ssh` into the host on both terminals:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ssh %bastion_ssh_user_name%@%bastion_public_hostname%
----

=== Git repository

With access to the bastion host, on the top terminal,  clone the Git repository
with the exercises for the lab. They are located under
https://github.com/rlopez133/demos

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
git clone https://github.com/rlopez133/demos
----

[NOTE]
====
All the exercises for this lab will be found under the `demos/eda_ocp`
directory. There is a folder associated for each exercise.
====

=== Install the Ansible Rulebook podman image

Within the bastion host, on the top terminal, pull the container image for the
Ansible Rulebook via:

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
podman pull quay.io/ansible/ansible-rulebook:v0.12.0
----

This will be used to run the Ansible Rulebooks without the need to install
Ansible Rulebooks directly on the bastion host.

=== Access automation controller dashboard

Via a browser, ensure you can access the automation controller dashboard. Within
the Ansible Automation Platform dashboard, you can see the Job Templates created
for each of the exercises under `Resources->Templates`. When an Ansible Rulebook
triggers due to an event, you will be able to see the Job Template running
within the `Views->Jobs` section of the Ansible Automation Platform dashboard.

URL: {aap_controller_web_url}

username: {aap_controller_admin_user}

password: {aap_controller_admin_password}

== Understanding the Provided Ansible Playbook

The provided Ansible playbook, `pvc_snapshot_playbook.yml`, automates the
process of creating a VolumeSnapshot for a newly added Persistent Volume Claim
(PVC) in a OpenShift cluster. The playbook consists of a series of tasks
ensuring the Persistent Volume Claim gets created and provides details on the
Volume Snapshot.

[NOTE]
====
The Ansible Playbook is provided as the purpose of the lab
is to focus on creating Ansible Rulebooks and understanding how they trigger an
Ansible Job based upon an event.
====

The Ansible playbook contains four tasks:

* The first task waits for a PVC to enter the "Bound" status. It uses the `kubernetes.core.k8s_info` module to gather information about the PVC, based on the event's namespace and name. The task will keep retrying until the PVC reaches the "Bound" status or the maximum number of retries is reached.

* The second task creates a VolumeSnapshot using the `kubernetes.core.k8s` module. This task will only execute if the PVC is in the "Bound" status.  The rescue section contains error handling and debugging tasks. If the PVC fails to reach the "Bound" status, the rescue section will be executed, providing debug information and a message that the PVC never achieved the "Bound" status.

* The third task retrieves the details of a Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot resource using the `kubernetes.core.k8s_info` module.

* The fourth task prints the name and namespace of each VolumeSnapshot retrieved in the previous task using the `ansible.builtin.debug` module

== Writing the Ansible Rulebook

In this section, you will be provided with an example Ansible Rulebook. Your
task is to modify the example rulebook to run the Ansible Job Template
`EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1` when a `PersistentVolumeClaim` gets created.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
.Example Rulebook
----
- name: Example Rulebook
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - my_event_source:
        api_version: v1
        kind: SomeResource
  rules:
    - name: Perform Action
      condition: event.type == "SOME_EVENT"
      action:
        run_job_template:
          name: Example-Job-Template
          organization: Default
----

Follow these steps to modify the example rulebook:

. Copy the example rulebook to a file named `exercise1-rulebook.yml` within the `/home/lab-user/demos/eda_ocp/exercise_1`
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the `vi` editor, to ensure that the formating of the pasted content is
preserved, enter command mode by pressing the `Esc` key and type the following
`:set paste` followed by enter. Then insert the content at the current cursor
position by pressing the `i` key to enter insert mode.
====
+
. Change the name of the rulebook from `Example Rulebook` to `Monitor for new PVCs and create snapshots`
. Update the `sources` section to use the appropriate source and watch for the proper Kubernetes objects. Replace `my_event_source` with the appropriate event source (`sabre1041.eda.k8s`). Replace `SomeResource` with `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
+
WARNING: The values are cap-sensitive. Ensure proper capitalization of `PersistentVolumeClaim`
+
[NOTE]
====
The event source _sabre1041.eda.k8s_ is a source module that enables the
consumption of changes originating from an OpenShift cluster which can then be
used to trigger automation to respond and act based on the received content and
configured rules.
====
+
. Modify the rule named `Perform Action` to `Create Snapshot`. Update the condition to create a snapshot when a Persistent Volume Claim is created via `event.type == "ADDED"`
. Change the name of the run_job_template from `Example-Job-Template` to `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1`
. Save your changes within the `vi` editor by entering command mode by pressing the `Esc` key and typing `:wq` followed by the Enter key.

WARNING: Ensure that your job template name matches `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1`

==  Run the Ansible Rulebook

In order to run the Ansible Rulebook you will take advantage of the existing
quay.io Ansible Rulebook image that was pulled with in the prerequisites section
and make some slight modifications within the container.

. As the `lab-user` within your bastion host, on the top terminal, change directory to the Git repository demos folder
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /home/lab-user/demos/eda_ocp/
----
+
. Capture the image ID of the Ansible Rulebook image
+
----
podman images
REPOSITORY                        TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
quay.io/ansible/ansible-rulebook  v0.12.0     ddab79939a21  13 days ago  1.68 GB
----
+
. Start the ansible-rulebook container and access it.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
podman run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/mnt:Z" --workdir /mnt --user 0 ddab79939a21 /bin/bash
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Modify the Image ID ddab79939a21 if different than the Image ID provided within
the podman images command.
====
+
. Within the ansible-rulebook container, run the `setup.sh`
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
(app-root) (app-root) ./setup.sh
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This installs pip packages `kubernetes`, `requests` and installs the
`sabre1041.eda` collection required for our Ansible Rulebook and Ansible
Playbook. It also installs the `oc` binary required to interactive with our
OpenShift cluster.
====
+
. Login to your OpenShift cluster via
+

== Create the RocketChat App

In this section, you'll deploy an app called Rocket.Chat, an open-source
communication platform known for its flexibility and security. It's ideal for
organizations that prioritize privacy, allowing real-time chats with your team,
other businesses, or clients across various devices and integrated channels like
social media and email.

For this exercise, we won't focus on using Rocket Chat itself, but rather on how
its deployed components can trigger our Ansible Rulebook. By monitoring for a
specific event, such as the creation of a Persistent Volume Claim, the Rocket
Chat deployment will initiate this event, causing our Ansible Rulebook to launch
the Ansible Job Template 'EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1'.

Now, let's go through the steps to deploy the Rocket Chat application.

. Within the bottom terminal window, ssh into the bastion host if not already.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
ssh {bastion_ssh_user_name}@{bastion_public_hostname}
----
+
. Login using your token within this new terminal window.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
oc login --token={openshift_bearer_token} --server={openshift_api_url}
----
+
. Within the Git repository, access the `/home/lab-user/demos/eda_ocp/exercise_1` directory.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
cd /home/lab-user/demos/eda_ocp/exercise_1
----
+
. Create a namespace to host the RocketChat app
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
oc new-project rocketchat
----
+
. Install the RocketChat App via the `app.yml` file within the exercise_1 directory.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
$ oc create -f app.yml
----
+
. Once the PVC is bound to the application, this will trigger the Ansible Rulebook to run the Ansible Job `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1` that will create a snapshot of the PVC.
+
. Looking at the top terminal window with the Ansible Rulebook container running you will see output similar to:
+
----
...
2023-04-26 19:05:21,598 - ansible_rulebook.builtin - INFO - running job template: EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1, organization: Default
2023-04-26 19:05:21,598 - ansible_rulebook.builtin - INFO - ruleset: Listen for newly added PVC resources and create a snapshot, rule Create Snapshot
----
+
. Head toward your browser with the Ansible Automation Platform dashboard and login (if not already). Within the dashboard, head to `Views->Jobs` and you will see the `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise1` job is launched and running.
. Once you see the Ansible Job has completed successfully, verify the snapshot has been created. On the bottom terminal window, run the command:
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
oc get volumesnapshot -n rocketchat
----
+
----

----
+
. Congratulations! You now have completed Exercise 1 of creating a PVC Snapshot upon application creation.

== Expanding on this exercise

What else could you do with this Ansible Rulebook?

One idea could be to add a scheduler to the PVC creation process where the
Ansible Job runs daily, weekly, monthly based on your compliance
requirements for your snapshots.

== Accessing the Rocket Chat Application

Prior to moving to the following exercise, I wanted to point out that when you
go to the Rocket Chat URL within your web browser, notice how a self-signed
certificate is used. 

To get the Rocket Chat URL, within the bottom terminal:

----
oc get routes
----

----
NAME          HOST/PORT                                                                PATH   SERVICES      PORT
 TERMINATION   WILDCARD
rocket-chat   rocket-chat-rocketchat.apps.cluster-58x8n.58x8n.sandbox514.opentlc.com          rocket-chat   3000
               None
----

Via your browser access the Rocket Chat URL, e.g.
`rocket-chat-rocketchat.apps.cluster-58x8n.58x8n.sandbox514.opentlc.com`, and
notice how the Rocket Chat App uses a self-signed certificate.

image::images/rocketchat_not_secure.png[]

[NOTE]
====
If the Rocket Chat application doesn't immediately load, it may still completing
the installation process.
====

In Exercise 2, you will learn how to use Ansible Rulebooks to automate the
process of providing a valid Lets Encrypt certificate to enhance the security of
the Rocket Chat application via the use of proper SSL certificates.

== Cleanup Rocket Chat App

As we will be using the RocketChat App for the next exercise, lets remove it as
we will be using it to trigger our next event relating SSL management.

To remove:
