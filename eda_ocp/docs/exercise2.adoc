== Configuring SSL Management with Ansible Rulebooks

In this exercise, you will create an Ansible Rulebook that triggers an Ansible
Job within automation controller when a Route to an OpenShift application is
created.

You will work with an Ansible playbook that performs the following tasks:

* Creates an Issuer 
* Generates a Certificate 
* Patches Rocket Chat's OpenShift Route with a properly signed SSL certificate 

Your objective is to develop an Ansible Rulebook that activates this Ansible
playbook through an Ansible Job within the automation controller.


== Prerequisites

* Access to your Bastion Host Credentials
* Access to your controller admin token
* Access to the automation controller dashboard
* SSH capabilities to the Bastion Host via terminal

NOTE: The Prerequisites details can all be found within the Overview section.

== Understanding the Provided Ansible Playbook

This Ansible playbook is specifically designed to configure a Let's Encrypt
certificate and apply it to an application in OpenShift leveraging the
capabilities of both the Cert-Manager Operator and the Cert-Utils Operator. It
employs Let's Encrypt, a well-respected Certificate Authority, to acquire a
properly signed SSL certificate. Let's Encrypt has gained widespread popularity
due to its provision of free SSL certificates and the automation it offers for
obtaining, renewing, and managing these certificates.

The Cert-Manager Operator plays a crucial role in overseeing the entire
lifecycle of SSL certificates within Kubernetes and OpenShift environments. In
conjunction with the Cert-Manager Operator, the Cert-Utils Operator is
responsible for automatically patching the TLS certificate and key onto the
Route whenever it is triggered by an event being watched by the Ansible
Rulebook.

The following is a breakdown of the tasks being performed by the Ansible playbook:

. *Define variables:* The playbook starts by defining various variables required for the configuration process. These include the issuer's name (Let's Encrypt), namespace, email, certificate name, namespace, DNS names, secret name, route name, and route namespace.
. *Create Issuer:* The first task in the playbook is to create an Issuer using the `kubernetes.core.k8s` module. An Issuer is a cert-manager resource responsible for issuing certificates. In this case, the Issuer is configured to use the Let's Encrypt Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) server to obtain SSL certificates.
. *Create Certificate:* The second task creates a Certificate resource, which requests an SSL certificate from the previously created Issuer (Let's Encrypt). It specifies the required DNS names, issuer reference, and private key settings.
. *Patch Route with Cert Manager Annotations:* The final task patches the OpenShift Route with Cert Manager annotations using the `kubernetes.core.k8s` module. This step ensures that the Route is updated with the newly created SSL certificate and its associated metadata. The `cert-utils-operator.redhat-cop.io/certs-from-secret` annotation is particularly important, as it tells the Cert-Utils Operator to watch the specified secret and automatically patch the TLS certificate and key to the Route when it's updated.

== Writing the Ansible Rulebook

In this section, you will be provided with an example rulebook. Your task is to
modify the example rulebook to run the Ansible Job Template
`EDA-OpenShift-Exercise2` when a `Route` gets created.

[{format_cmd_exec}]
.Example Rulebook
----
- name: Example Rulebook
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - my_event_source:
        api_version: v1
        kind: SomeResource
  rules:
    - name: Perform Action
      condition: event.type == "SOME_EVENT"
      action:
        run_job_template:
          name: Example-Job-Template
          organization: Default
----

Follow these steps to modify the example rulebook:

. Copy the example rulebook to a file named `exercise2-rulebook.yml` within the `/home/lab-user/demos/eda_ocp/exercise_2` directory.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using the `vi` editor, to ensure that the formating of the pasted content is
preserved, enter command mode by pressing the `Esc` key and type the following
`:set paste` followed by enter. Then insert the content at the current cursor
position by pressing the `i` key to enter insert mode.
====
+
. Change the name of the rulebook from `Example Rulebook` to `Listen for newly created Route`.
. Update the `sources` section to use the appropriate source and watch for the proper Kubernetes objects. Replace `my_event_source` with the appropriate event source (`sabre1041.eda.k8s`). Replace `SomeResource` with `Route`.
+
WARNING: The values are cap-sensitive. Ensure proper capitalization of `Route`
+
[NOTE]
====
The event source _sabre1041.eda.k8s_ is a source module that enables the
consumption of changes originating from an OpenShift cluster which can then be
used to trigger automation to respond and act based on the received content and
configured rules.
====
+
. Modify the rule named `Perform Action` to `Patch a Route`. Update the condition to patch a route when a Route is created via `event.type == "ADDED"`
. Change the name of the run_job_template from `Example-Job-Template` to `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise2`
. Save your changes within the `vi` editor by entering command mode by pressing the `Esc` key and typing `:wq` followed by the Enter key.

WARNING: Ensure that your job template name matches `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise2`

the exercise.

==  Run the Ansible Rulebook

In order to run the Ansible Rulebook we will take advantage of the existing
quay.io Ansible Rulebook image that was pulled in the previous exercise.

[NOTE]
====
Within the top terminal window, if you are still connected to the bastion host
and within the Ansible Rulebook container, `Ctrl-C` to stop the Ansible Rulebook
command running from Exercise 1. Steps 1-5 may be skipped.

Otherwise continue with the steps as provided to create a new container.
====

== Create the Rocket Chat App

With our Ansible Rulebook watching for an event, we will now create the Rocket
Chat application that will trigger the Ansible Rulebook once a Route is created.

[NOTE]
====
If your bottom terminal window is already logged into the bastion host, steps
1-2 may be skipped.
====

. Within the bottom terminal window, ssh into the bastion host.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]

[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
oc project rocketchat
----
+
. Install the RocketChat App via the `app.yml` file
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
oc create -f app.yml
----
+
. Once the Route is created for the Rocket Chat application, this will trigger the Ansible Rulebook to run the Ansible Job `EDA-OpenShift-Exercise2` that will patch the Route with the Lets Encrypt certificate.
+
. Looking at the top terminal window with the Ansible Rulebook container running you will see output similar to:

. Once you see the Ansible Job has completed successfully, verify the Route
contains the Let's Encrypt certificate.
+
[{format_cmd_exec}]
----
$ oc get routes
----
+
. Using the Route URL, head to your browser and copy paste the link provided. You should now notice the Rocket Chat application has a proper SSL certificate which can be identified with the lock icon.
+

. Congratulations! You now have completed Exercise 2 of applying properly signed certificates to applications created within OpenShift.

== Summary

In this exercise, you learned how to automatically configure a Let's Encrypt SSL
certificate for OpenShift Routes using Ansible Automation Platform.

You learned how to:

. Write an Ansible Rulebook that listens for newly created Routes and patches them with SSL certificates when triggered.
. Understand the provided Ansible playbook, which leverages Cert-Manager Operator and Cert-Utils Operator to configure a Let's Encrypt certificate for an OpenShift application.
. Run the Ansible Rulebook using the quay.io Ansible Rulebook image.
. Verify that the Route contains the Let's Encrypt certificate and observe the proper SSL certificate applied to the Rocket Chat app in the browser.
